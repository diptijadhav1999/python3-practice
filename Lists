# Code starts here
# create list of weights
weights=[70,80,45,50]
# maximum weight
maximum=max(weights)
#print(weights)
print(maximum)

# change values
weights[2]=48

# calculate sum
total=sum(weights)
print(total)


# calculate mean
mean=total/len(weights)
print(mean)


RESULT

The value of 'maximum' should be 80.
The calculated value of 'total' should be 248.
The calculated value of 'mean' should be 62.

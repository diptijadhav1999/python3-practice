# create tuple of weights
weights = (70, 80, 45, 50)

# Code starts here
weights_new=(70,80,48,50)
# create new tuple of weights
# calculate maximum and minimum weights
maximum=max(weights_new)
minimum=min(weights_new)
print(maximum)
print(minimum)
# calculate sum of weights
sum_weights=sum(weights_new)
print(sum_weights)
# calculate mean
mean_new=sum_weights/len(weights_new)
print(mean_new)
# Code ends here

RESULT
 The value of maximum should be 80.
The value of minimum should be 48.
The calculated value of sum_weights should be 248.
The calculated value of mean_new should be 62.0.
